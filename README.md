# 42_C02
Exercises from the C02 project from 42, made during the sixth piscine from 42 Porto.
Every exercise was checked by moulinnete and was made by the norm.
There's already a main inside the files for easy testing, just remove the comments and you should be fine 

--Exercises issues--

Exercise 09 is a hot mess and i do not recommend you doing  the way that i did, it's way easier if you 
start by calling another function to put every letter lowercase and then doing the necessary checks
to capitalize the letters that you need. Also C02 from the start you're basically creating <string.h>
instead of creating all the checks i did
